This was a group project to create an informative educational app. This applications takes data from the RedList (Endangered Species list) API and 
displays the information in a way which hopefully makes the user realise just what a problem there is. 

It is written in Javascript with a mongoDB database.  The backend has a manual dataLoader which pulls all the required data 
from the API and populates the database. The data is changing so infrequently there seemed no need to make this a continual 
process. The data in the API is quite fragmented and so it takes many calls to the API to copy all the data across.


To run:

npm install
npm start

mongod - run the database mongodb. 


run bulkLoadController   - to get actual data from Red List API

run localhost:3005 in the browser
